		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<p>My name is Tyler Luther and I am a high school student. I enjoy using technology and learning about it. My favorite category is mobile phones, but I like to code; especially creating my own functioning scripts. I use my computer to learn and discover information, for editing purposes, and for inspiration. My goals in life are to become more active and also in the long term, change the lives of people in a positive way.
